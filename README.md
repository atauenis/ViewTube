### External

If no video plugin is installed it's possible to use an external player for video playback. This requires the use of a browser protocol and a script that has to be associated with it. Read here for more info: http://sebaro.pro/viewtube

### Internal

If no video plugin is installed the browser will use the HTML5 video player for video playback. It is the defaut, the 'Video' option in the embed menu from the options window.


## Options

#### Embed (Video, Object, Embed, Protocol)
   - Select which type of embed option to use when playing the videos. Choose "Video" if you want to use the browser video player (HTML5), "Object" or "Embed" if you want to use a plugin (NPAPI, not supported anymore by most browsers) or "Protocol" if you want to use an external player. :

#### Media
   - Select which type of media or plugin to use when embeding the video. Choose "Auto" so the video is embedded using its own media/mime type, choose other option for embedding the video with a different media type or with a plugin.

#### Definition (SD, HD etc)
   - Select the default (highest) video definition.

#### Container (MP4, WebM etc)
   - Select the default video container.

#### Autoplay
   - Enable/disable video autoplay. If it's on the video starts to play when the video page is loaded or when a new video format is selected. If it's off a video thumbnail is shown.

#### DASH
   - Enable/disable DASH streams (video with audio) playback. Available options are "HTML5/Video" and "Embed+VLC". The default option is "HTML5/Video". Select "Embed" and "VLC" in the embed and media menus to use VLC instead. This is experimental and it may not work as expected. An external player can also be used.

#### DVL
   - Enable/disable auto selection of DVL as the default option in the videos menu. With DVL only the video link is embedded so the video streams are fetched by the video plugin, directly or using an external application. The plugins that support this are MPV (mozplugger + mpv + youtube-dl) and VLC.
